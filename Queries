# Hotel Project

step 1: First all the data was converted to csv file and then loaded to Mysql workbench

Step2: then started writing queries based on the questions asked. 

Step 3: 

```sql
#query is used to count the number of rows in the hotel_2018 table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM project.hotel_2018;

#query is used to count the number of rows in the hotel_2019 table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM project.hotel_2019;

#query is used to count the number of rows in the hotel_2020 table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM project.hotel_2020;

#query is used to count the number of rows in the hotel_2020 table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM project.hotel_2020;

#combining the rows from the hotel_2018, hotel_2019, and hotel_2020 tables into a single result set using the UNION operator. 
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020;

#Question: Is hotel revenue growing by year? 
#but we dont have revenue column in the hotel_2018 table. So now we have to create new column as revenue by adding stays_in_weekend_night and stays_in_week_nights then multiply by adr which is average daily rate.
#lets first create temporary table creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named hotels

WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

Select (stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr as revenue
FROM hotels
#output for this is shown below: 
```

```sql
#lets find out the revenue for each year
WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

SELECT 
arrival_date_year, (stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr as revenue
FROM hotels

The output is: 
```

```sql
#lets group by year and find the total sum of revenue for each year
WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

SELECT 
	arrival_date_year, 
	sum((stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr) as revenue
FROM hotels
GROUP BY arrival_date_year

The output is shown below: 
```

Insight: 

From the output we see that each year the revenue is growing. 

### Question 2: We need to find out revenue by each Hotel type?

```sql
#lets add hotel column in the above query and group by hotel. Also let's round the numerical value by 2 decimal places
WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

SELECT 
	arrival_date_year, 
    hotel,
	round(sum((stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr),2) as revenue
FROM hotels
GROUP BY arrival_date_year, hotel

The output is: 
```

Insight: 

- It shows that the revenue is growing for city hotel from 2018 to 2019 and decreasing sightly in 2020.
- The revenue for Resort Hotel grew from 2018 to 2019 and shrink a bit in 2020.

Part 2:

Joining tables for data visualization in Tableau/Microsoft PowerBI

We have another table which is “market_segment”. It has two columns. Also there is “market_segment” column in all three tables i.e. hotel_2018, hotel_2019, hotel_2020 which is combined as hotel.

```sql
#join market_segment table with the hotels table.

WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

SELECT * from hotels
LEFT JOIN project.market_segment
ON hotels.market_segment = market_segment.market_segment
```

Output: 

Two new column on the far right “Discount” and “market_segment” are joined in the hotel table.

Also join meal_cost table with the hotels table

```sql
WITH hotels as (
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2018
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2019
UNION
SELECT *
FROM project.hotel_2020)

SELECT * from hotels
LEFT JOIN project.market_segment
ON hotels.market_segment = market_segment.market_segment
ON meal_cost.meal = hotels.meal
```

Output: 

Two new column on the far right “cost” and “meal” are joined in the above table.
